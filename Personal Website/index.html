                            on this learning journey together, as we explore the limitless possibilities of machine

                        <h2>Sports Analytics</h2>
                        <p>I have always been a fan of all kinds of sports and have a deep interest in the role that
                            statistics play. Recognizing the immense impact data-driven insights have on enhancing team
                            performance and strategic decision-making within sports, I am particularly drawn to the
                            fascinating field of sports analytics. My passion for both sports and analytics has inspired
                            me to explore how advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms can
                            uncover hidden patterns in player performance, optimize team strategies, and revolutionize
                            the way we understand and enjoy sports. I am eager to further my knowledge in sports
                            analytics and contribute to the advancement of this dynamic field, leveraging data to drive
                            innovation and success in the world of sports.</p>

                        <h2>Programming</h2>
                        <p>The very thing that had gotten me into programming and software engineering in the first
                            place was the possibility to automate tasks and actions. In short, I like to make things
                            that do things. Whether it's making a robotic arm move from
                            one point to another, to making applicaiton that can handle my daily schedule for me. It
                            started during my freshman year at Lawrence Tech where I got tired of solving problems in my
                            differential equations class. At the same time, I was taking an introduction to programming
                            class. So I decided to make a calculator that helped me solve the problems that I had in my
                            differential equations class. The fun part came whenver I could add on to it to solve
                            different kinds of problems and use it in other class.</p>
